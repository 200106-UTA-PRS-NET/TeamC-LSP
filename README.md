# LISKOV PRINCIPLE

The Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data abstraction” in 1987. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:

“Let φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.”

Or in other words if S is a subtype of T. Objects of type S can replace objects of type T without introducing errors or modification of T.

Extends the Open/Closed principle and enables you to replace objects of a parent class with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.
